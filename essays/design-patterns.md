  Design patterns are helpful for solving many common problems that occur in coding. Whether it's properly creating classes and methods, interactions between objects or inheritance, creating reusable code or a design pattern is good because it helps you maintain things and not have such a chaotic code (when you eventually get to many lines of code in a program). Three main types of design patterns are creational, structural, and behavioral. Creational is based on object "creation", such as singleton or factory. Class creation patterns use inheritance, while object creation uses delegation. Structural is more about making a larger "structure", or to make a new functionality from different classes.  Behavioral is about finding the "behavior" of the classes. It finds how one class interacts with another and realizes patterns between objects.
