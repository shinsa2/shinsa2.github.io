Recently in class, we've been learning how to use Semantic UI. It's a lot more helpful than writing your own code for everything you need. For example, they have certain pre-made classes for you to use, such as "menu" to create a menu bar or even "inverted" to change the colors to be inverted. In my own personal opinion, it's better to learn these different UI frameworks because it helps you write "cleaner-looking" code, in a sense. One might get frustrated by the amount of time it takes to successfully memorize these different UI frameworks because it's almost like learning a new language. However, it is very useful to use these premade setups. For example, in class, we made copies of websites without Semantic UI, and with Semantic UI. I feel like with Semantic UI, the CSS looked so much cleaner and we needed to write less code.

Some people may prefer using raw HTML and CSS, but it will be easier to read with the UI frameworks. With the less amount of raw code needed to write, it also greatly benefits the coder (high reward for the equally high amount of time spent to learn the framework(s) you want to use). Raw HTML and CSS does have more flexibility, however. Because frameworks sometimes use "!important" in their code, sometimes it may be hard to overwrite that with another "!important" in your own personal CSS. This sometimes creates problems in making something in a way that you'd want to personalize. Veterans may be able to overcome this problem easily, but I had some trouble with my projects to override the Semantic UI framework. However, I still prefer having a framework to work with, as it helps me practice by being able to create new projects that don't need to be perfected yet.
