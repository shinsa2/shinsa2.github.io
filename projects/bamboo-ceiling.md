summary: I had to come up with an idea and write a paper with no rubric or subject list besides relating it to the class.

Given no guidelines or rules for this project, we were to write an interesting paper, which would pull the reader in, about anything in my life that related to the course (American Studies - Racism). This is one of the only (if not only) projects I've had, where I was told to do basically whatever I wanted. This paper helped me with my creativity, as I had to think up my own topic of what could possibly relate to anything we've learned in the course. In the paper, as I'm Asian American myself, I wrote about an Asian American hip hop artist who wrote a song about racism in hollywood today. Racism in black and white America back in the day was terrible, and even to this day, minorities are treated unfairly in the business world and other arts such as music.
