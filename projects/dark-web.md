For this project, I had to make a presentation of a topic that interested me. I chose the dark web, because it always seemed mysterious and people think of it as a dangerous place to be. This presentation helped me jump start my interest in the CS security field, as I was already interested in these things, but didn't start moving toward an education or career in this field until completion of this project.
