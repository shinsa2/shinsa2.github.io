For this project, I had to make a presentation of a topic that interested me. I chose the dark web, because it always seemed mysterious and people think of it as a dangerous place to be. I clarified some things and went into a little more detail about what the dark web and deep web really are. There's a little confusion between the two, as the "deep" web is not as deep as the dark web. This presentation helped me jump start my interest in the CS security field, as I was already interested in these things, but didn't start moving toward an education or career in this field until completion of this project.
