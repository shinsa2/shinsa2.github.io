<h2>What is Ono Manoa Grindz</h2>
Ono Manoa Grindz is a web app where you can find food places around the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus. It allows users to create accounts to write reviews, and shows the food vendors' menus, hours, and locations. It's very similar to yelp, as we used it as an inspiration for our app.

<h2>Contributions</h2>
The main parts I made were: the admin pages, where only admin are allowed to edit, delete, and add new vendors to the app; the vendor page itself, where individual vendors are in separate cards with their information and links to a full description in addition to hours, location, map location, and a menu; the menu and vendor information which is grabbed from the database; and the header and footer of all pages. I believe I played a great role in this project, not only as doing a lot of the main work, but also as always finishing my parts of the project as soon as I could, because I knew other members in my group were struggling, so I'd be able to help them as well.
